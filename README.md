# DinersFriend

This app is designed to help out when a check arrives at a table. It is able to both calculate a tip and to split the bill evenly.
I understand that an even split may not be the most "fair" approach, especially if someone orders a huge prime rib with drinks and someone
else orders a side salad with water, but that's a whole separate problem to solve.

This project started life as a coding assignment for my mobile programming class. Since then, I have come to realize that there is a solid
need for something like this for people that are like my wife (and occasionally me. as well) when the check shows up. At some point, this
will find it's way into the Play Store.

I dove back into the code and tried to organize things better using some clean coding concepts. I also put in validation of input, largely
to present a crash resulting from a divide by zero if the number of people is input as "0".

If you have any comments, suggestions, or bugs, please let me know at ray@rayphoenix.net

Enjoy!
